I love Jujutsu Kaisen because of its intense action and the way it mixes dark, supernatural themes with humor. Yuji's character really resonates with me. He's funny and carefree, but also has this strong sense of duty when it comes to helping others. The cursed world is fascinating, and every fight scene is beautifully animated and full of energy.
Not to forget Gojo, what a legend he is!
