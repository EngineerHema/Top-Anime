Bleach is amazing to me because of its incredible lore and unique powers that each character has.
Ichigo's journey from an ordinary guy to a powerful Soul Reaper is really exciting,
and the epic battles he faces,
especially in the Soul Society arc, are some of the best.
I love how the series keeps expanding its universe,
making it feel like an endless adventure.
And when anyone mentions bleach, you shouldn't forget Aizen...
OMG! That guy is the real G.O.A.T, the perfect villian.
Maybe he is the one that planned for me to make this website!XD
