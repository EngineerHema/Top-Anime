Death Note pulls me in with its psychological thrill. The battle of wits between Light and L is so intense, and the whole idea of the Death Note itself is mind-blowing. It makes me think a lot about morality and power, whether it's right to control life and death like that. Every episode has me on the edge of my seat.
