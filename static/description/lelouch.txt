Code Geass is one of my favorites because of how smart the story is. Lelouch is a genius, and watching him plan out his rebellion with all the twists and turns is just incredible. The way the series blends mecha action with deep political and moral questions keeps me hooked. And Lelouch's struggle between doing the right thing and achieving his goals is something I find really captivating.
This anime has the best ending ever that no other anime could surpass
